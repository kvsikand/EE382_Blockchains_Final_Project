## Mining Pool Rewards Simulator

This Monte-Carlo simulation emulates a single miner acting alone or as part of 3 different pools, each with different reward schemes.

It includes the ability to set block rewards, the chances of the individual and the pool winning the mining race, and a number of other configurable options. To run this simulator, use

`python mining_pool_sim.py`

For a detailed breakdown of the available options, use
